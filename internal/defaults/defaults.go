// DefaultPort is the HTTP port the MCP server listens on. Uses 9090 to avoid
// conflict with the Solace broker's SEMP management port (default 8080).
const DefaultPort = 9090

// DefaultShutdownTimeoutSeconds is the maximum time in seconds the MCP server
// waits for in-flight SEMP API calls to complete during graceful shutdown.
//
// Assumption: 120 seconds is sufficient for worst-case request completion.
// Reasoning: A composite tool may execute up to 3 sequential SEMP calls, each
// with a 30-second timeout, plus overhead. 120s provides a 30s safety margin.
// Validation needed: Measure actual broker response times under load to confirm
// or adjust this value.
const DefaultShutdownTimeoutSeconds = 120

// DefaultSEMPRequestTimeoutDuration is the per-request timeout for individual
// SEMP API calls to a broker. Matches the story spec default and the Solace
// Terraform provider convention.
const DefaultSEMPRequestTimeoutDuration = time.Minute

// DefaultMaxConcurrentPerBroker is the maximum number of concurrent SEMP
// requests allowed per broker, enforced via a per-broker semaphore.
//
// Assumption: 10 concurrent requests is a safe default per broker.
// Reasoning: The KA document indicates 1-10 concurrent agent sessions as
// typical usage. This limit protects the broker management plane from overload.
// Validation needed: Load test against real brokers to determine the optimal
// concurrency limit that balances throughput with broker stability.
const DefaultMaxConcurrentPerBroker = 10

// DefaultTLSSkipVerify controls whether TLS certificate verification is skipped
// when connecting to brokers. Must be false in production. Only set to true in
// development environments with self-signed certificates.
const DefaultTLSSkipVerify = false

// DefaultReadHeaderTimeoutSeconds is the maximum time in seconds the HTTP
// server waits for a client to send request headers before closing the
// connection. Protects against Slowloris attacks (gosec G112).
//
// Assumption: 10 seconds is sufficient for MCP clients to send headers.
// Reasoning: MCP clients are automated software (Claude Code, ChatGPT agents)
// that send headers instantly. 10 seconds is generous for congested networks.
// This only covers header reading — once headers are received, the connection
// can stay open indefinitely for MCP streaming (SSE).
// Validation needed: Monitor for rejected connections in production to confirm
// this value is not too aggressive for real-world network conditions.
const DefaultReadHeaderTimeoutSeconds = 10

// DefaultConfigPath is the default file path for the broker configuration YAML file.

// server (slog.LevelInfo).
const DefaultLogLevel = "info"

// DefaultRequestMinInterval is the minimum spacing between successive SEMP
// requests against the same broker, enforced by a future rate limiter (Story 5).
// Matches the story spec and the Solace Terraform provider default (100ms).
const DefaultRequestMinInterval = 100 * time.Millisecond

// DefaultRetries is the maximum number of retry attempts for a failed SEMP
// request before surfacing the error to the caller. Used by the future retry
// logic (Story 5). Zero disables retries entirely. Matches the story spec and
// Terraform provider default.
const DefaultRetries = 10

// DefaultRetryMinInterval is the starting backoff duration before the first
// retry attempt. Subsequent retries grow toward DefaultRetryMaxInterval via
// exponential backoff (Story 5). Matches the story spec and Terraform default.
const DefaultRetryMinInterval = 3 * time.Second

// DefaultRetryMaxInterval caps the retry backoff duration regardless of how
// many attempts have been made. Must be >= DefaultRetryMinInterval. Matches
// the story spec and Terraform default.
